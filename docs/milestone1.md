## How to Use 

## Software Organization
- What will the directory structure look like?
- What modules do you plan on including? What is their basic functionality?
- Where will your test suite live? Will you use TravisCI? CodeCov?
- How will you distribute your package (e.g. PyPI)?
- How will you package your software? Will you use a framework? If so, which one and why? If not, why not?
- Other considerations?

## Implementation
- What are the core data structures?
- What classes will you implement?
- What method and name attributes will your classes have?
- What external dependencies will you rely on?
- How will you deal with elementary functions like sin, sqrt, log, and exp (and all the others)?
