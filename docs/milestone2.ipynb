    "Differentiation is great. It is a necessity in a vast range of applications, such as atomic simulations, economic analysis, and machine learning. In the field of computational science, when functions and programs get complicated, differentiation can become burdensome. This is why we need *automatic differentiation*! It finds the derivative of numerical expressions to the accuracy of machine precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "`superdiff` performs automatic differentiation on single- or multi-variable functions using the _forward mode_ as well as the _reverse mode_. The function is stored as an `Expression` class that can output values and derivatives wherever you need it.\n"

    "Differentiation is the process of finding derivative, which is the rate of change of a function's output with regard to its variables. Take $f(x,y) =3*x^2+\\exp(y)$ as an example. Symbolic differentiation gives $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=6x$ and $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}=\\exp(y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic differentiation treats a function as a chain of elementary functions and performs differentiation on each elementry function. \n",
    "Here the elementary functions include: (1) A single arithmetic operation, such as $3*x$ and $x_1+x_2$. (2) A single trigonometric operation, such as $\\sin(x)$. (3) A single exponential or logarithmic opration, such as $\\log(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chain rule dictates that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{df(g(x))}{dx}=\\frac{df(x_1)}{dx_1}*\\frac{dg(x)}{dx}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a function that is made up of elementary functions can be extended into a computational graph. For $f(x,y) =3*x^2+\\exp(y)$, the graph is shown below. Each $x_i$ is the output of an elementary function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hBQvv4n.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "  \n",
    "To calulate the derivative of $f$ at $[x,\\ y]$, we pass the value of the previous $x_i$ and $x_i^\\prime$ into the next elementary function to evaluate the derivative of that elementary function. Below shows the forward mode automatic differentiation table. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1AIngxT.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"600\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative is computed using the chain rule. To get $\\dfrac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}$, forward mode starts from $\\dfrac{\\partial x_1}{\\partial x}$, while the reverse mode starts from $\\dfrac{\\partial x_6}{\\partial x_4}$. The result is \n",

    "## How to use superdiff\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is for the syntax of `superdiff` to be as natural as possible, not requiring the user to learn any new paradigms and thereby minimizing the chances of hard-to-debug errors. Therefore, we take inspiration from the kind of notation one might use when writing out mathematical expressions and functions by hand. For instance, we might have the rather complicated function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    f(x, y) = \\frac{x * 0.2 + (\\log(x))^3}{y}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The core functionality of `superdiff` involves three main kinds of objects: `Variable`, `Expression`, and subclasses of `Operation`. These mean exactly what you might expect from a mathematical context. If a user wants to define an expression, they do so with one or more `Variable`s, and any arbitrary number of `Operation`s. To make a new `Expression` object, the user combines these `Variable` and `Operation` objects in the constructor of the `Expression`, simultaneously defining the ordering of the variables for later use.\n",

    "\n",
    "Our test suite will live inside the `tests/` subdirectory under `superdiff/`. `diff_test.py` will include many unit tests to ensure the differentiator modules run correctly and handle edge cases appropriately for a variety of complex functions. They will also more closely test many of the operations abstracted away under the hood to ensure quality is maintained beneath all the layers. Additionally, we will also apply stress tests to see how our package handles overloading. `pytest` will be key in handling this test suite efficiently.\n",

    "The function to be differentiated (henceforth referred to as ƒ) will be parsed and converted into a directed graph, containing node-like objects for each row in the traceplot (i.e. for each elementary operation in ƒ). The edges of the graph will represent steps from one part of the traceplot to the next.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, C knows about A and B, but not about F. This may seem counterintuitive, since in the forward mode of autodiff, we need to go from A to C to F. However, we want to allow for situations like the following:\n",

    "![](https://i.imgur.com/eWljQhb.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the function `f3` is composed of two inputs (`f1` and `f2`) and combines them in an operation in node G. Rather than copying functions `f1` and `f2` into brand new graphs, we believe that it would be more memory- and time-efficient to simply refer to the same graph objects that `f1` and `f2` refer to. However, this creates a potential issue if we were to implement the graphs as bidirectional, rather than unidirectional: if we add a connection from G to C *and* C to G, then if the user tries to run the forward mode of autodiff on `f1`, the algorithm will continue past node C onto node G. However, node G is not part of function `f1`!\n",
    "\n",
    "This design choice has a tradeoff, namely that each time autodifferentiation is performed, Python must step from the end of the function all the way to the beginning leaf nodes. In development, we will run tests to determine if this significantly impacts performance. If it does, then we will consider strategies to alleviate the issue. One potential solution would be to make the graph bidirectional, but to also store a reference to the root node. Then, when the algorithm reaches the root node, it knows to stop.\n",
